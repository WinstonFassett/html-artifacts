## Brand & Style

Scrapbook design system. A clean, structured theme with Caveat and Inter typography. Use this design system\'s color tokens, spacing, and typographic choices consistently across all generated components. This theme **respects the visitor's system color scheme** — light by default, with a dark variant that auto-applies on `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Apply both color sets via CSS variables in a `<style>` block; never hard-code one mode only.
