## Brand & Style

Industrial design system. A clean, structured theme with Space Mono and Inter typography. Use this design system\'s color tokens, spacing, and typographic choices consistently across all generated components. This theme **respects the visitor's system color scheme** — light by default, with a dark variant that auto-applies on `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Apply both color sets via CSS variables in a `<style>` block; never hard-code one mode only.

## Colors

- **bg** (oklch(0.88 0.01 90)): Use for backgrounds.
- **text** (oklch(0.05 0.01 0)): Use for text content.
- **border** (oklch(0.05 0.01 0)): Use for borders and dividers.
- **accent** (oklch(0.90 0.20 110)): Use for primary actions and accents.
- **accent-text** (oklch(0.05 0.01 0)): Use for text content.
- **muted** (oklch(0.40 0.01 0)): Use for secondary/muted content.

## Typography

Load fonts from Google Fonts: Space Mono, Inter. Use display=optional.
Primary body font: 'Inter', sans-serif.

## Components

Apply the color tokens and typography consistently to all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, cards, modals). Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for accessibility.
