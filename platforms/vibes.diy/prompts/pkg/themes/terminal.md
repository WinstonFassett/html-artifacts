## Brand & Style

Terminal CRT design system. A dark, atmospheric theme with VT323 typography. Use this design system\'s color tokens, spacing, and typographic choices consistently across all generated components. This theme **respects the visitor's system color scheme** — dark by default, with a light variant that auto-applies on `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)`. Apply both color sets via CSS variables in a `<style>` block; never hard-code one mode only.
