# Flaky tests

Track: [VibesDIY/vibes.diy#1515](https://github.com/VibesDIY/vibes.diy/issues/1515)

`pnpm check` occasionally fails on tests that pass on rerun (or in isolation), with no code change between runs. Seen across multiple runners:

- **chromium browser tests**: `Invalid hook call` / `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')` — multiple React copies surfacing under the parallel chromium runner.
- **api-tests**: SQLite contention or state bleed between parallel suites (e.g. `owner cannot request access to own app`, `Result is Err`) — passes when run alone.

Not a regression in the changes under test.

## When you hit a flaky failure

1. **Rerun `pnpm check`** (or the specific suite in isolation, e.g. `cd vibes.diy/tests && pnpm test <pattern>`) before assuming it's a real failure. If it passes the second time with no code change, it's flaky.
2. **Add a comment to #1515** with the file/test names and the date. Do not edit existing comments — append.
3. **Proceed with the commit**. Do not block on flaky failures alone, and do not "fix" them by deleting the tests or marking them skipped.

## When NOT to call something flaky

- A test that fails consistently across reruns. That's a real failure — investigate.
- A test whose failure mode matches your code change (e.g., you touched the resolver and resolver tests fail). Even if it's "usually" flaky, the change might be real.

The issue exists so we can ignore known flakes during day-to-day work _and_ periodically batch-fix them with full context.
