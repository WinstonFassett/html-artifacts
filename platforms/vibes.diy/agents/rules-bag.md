# Vibes.diy – Fireproof Rules-Bag

## Scope

Rules-bag applies to repository-authored code in this repo.
Prompt-generated `App.jsx` is exempt while it remains generated output.

Never use `export default`, nor `import X from 'y'`
Every Never has an exception — but this has to be discussed and decided.

Never write JS, always TS

Never use `any`

Avoid casts — use at least 10 minutes to decide on one cast — better to ask others.

Use arktype(zod) if you do `const x = type({ x: "string" })(JSON.parse(y))`

Never use mocking — that means your architecture is wrong; any code with mocking will never be accepted by me/us.

Write the test first without the AI and use this to ask the AI how to implement. If you discover untestabilities change your implementation.

Do not use `new URL()` → use URI — URL is not stable in all aspects.

Our implementation never throws — use `Result`.

Avoid `if (!x)` // falsy check → Use Option `if (x.isSome())` → `if (x === true || x === "")` means you expected x to be a particular type; you are not looking for some falsy state.

### Explicit comparisons that are rules-bag-correct

The `if (!x)` rule forbids truthy/falsy coercion, not explicit value comparisons. The following are all correct and **should NOT** be flagged as falsy checks during review:

- `if (x === undefined)` — checks specifically for undefined
- `if (x !== undefined)` — checks for any non-undefined value
- `if (x === false)` — checks specifically for false (e.g., `if (r.isOk() === false)`)
- `if (x.length === 0)` — checks empty string/array
- `if (idx >= 0)` — checks present (find/findIndex result)
- `if (arr.find(...) !== undefined)` — checks find hit

What the rule forbids is the type-ambiguous shortcut `if (!x)`, which collapses multiple "falsy" states (undefined, null, 0, "", false) into one branch. The explicit forms above declare exactly which state you mean. `??` (nullish coalescing) for defaults also handles `undefined` precisely — rules-bag-correct.

Never add a fallback — fix the real code path. Ask an expert if the fix looks like it takes work to stitch in.

Never use `try/catch` → `exception2Result()`

Never implement a Singleton — use `ResolveOnce`/`Lazy`

Never Never Never use `Proxy` from ECMA

Avoid `instanceof`

Use `switch (true)` for dynamic filtering

Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns — but don't get obsessed with it. It's old, but it answers the OO aspect of today's hybrid model of OO + Functional.

Use `const`, `readonly attribute: string` as your default — it helps you not create a mutation without knowing.

Every side effect/mutation is expensive (debug cost, testing cost) — the best strategy is to avoid it at all costs.

Decide on ownership. Avoid `const list = [Element]`; if Element offers a `removeFromList`, you are in trouble.

Our codebase uses `undefined` as a falsy state. Bridge between React `null` → `undefined` or `Option.from()`.

Do not use `const fn = () => {}` as long as you don't need the implicit `this` binding. (Short notation is ok for inline use: `[].map(() => {})`)

Every transferred object needs implicit type matching like `{ type: "mytype", ... }` and an envelope like `{ id, src, dst, payload: { type: xxx } }`.

Never write optimized code — write code that other people/AI could understand.

Never use `new TextEncoder` or `new TextDecoder` — use `this.txt.encode`.

Use for CLI utils → `cmd-ts`

Use for script-like things → `zx`

Never write encoders/decoders yourself — use libraries, multiformats, cement.

Do not reimplement public knowledge like mime type mapping to extensions.

Build an architecture where integration tests are not needed and will never hit the actual infrastructure. Every regression test runs against the integration test infrastructure (building a regression test could take very long).

No overrides of packages — we need a very simple dependency structure due to nobuild requirements.

All `@fireproof/*` packages must be on the same patch version across the entire monorepo. A version split creates duplicate runtime stacks under pnpm, which can cause subtle storage/serialization mismatches between packages that share keybag, device-id, or runtime state.

Never use `constructor(private db: VibesSqlite) {}` — this is very bundle-unfriendly.

Never pass more than 3 parameters to a function; use typed objects instead. This is stricter when passing 3 parameters of the same type — that avoids mixing them up, like `setFullName(firstName, lastName)` → use `setFullName({ lastName, firstName })`.

Don't be shy about making things good — if you see `any[]` leaking from a JSON column, validate it with arktype. If a type is wrong, fix it now. Cutting corners on types creates debt that compounds silently.

Evento is an architectural boundary, not a convenience wrapper. When handlers from one package need to run in another package's evento, unify the message types — don't cast around the mismatch. If a cast is needed to register a handler, the envelope types are wrong.

## Good Patterns

### Typed message bridge (CLI → Evento)

cmd-ts command = thin adapter. Parse args, spread into typed Req DTO, enqueue. Handler reads `ctx.validated` — no casts.

```ts
handler: ctx.cliStream.enqueue((args) => {
  return { type: "core-cli.build", ...args };
});
```

## Lessons (real incidents)

### Don't overload an envelope field — [#2306](https://github.com/VibesDIY/vibes.diy/issues/2306)

`vibes.diy.evt-doc-changed` carried the **channel** name in its `dbName` field when an access function routed documents to a channel whose name differed from the database name. Browser `useLiveQuery` filters change events by the real db name, so live cross-user sync **silently** broke for every access-fn app where channel ≠ db name — single-user use and reload looked fine; it took two live users to surface. Fix shape: keep `dbName` = the real database name always, and carry channel routing in the dedicated `channel` field (already introduced in [#2301](https://github.com/VibesDIY/vibes.diy/issues/2301)) — never repurpose `dbName`. This is the "Evento is an architectural boundary — unify the message types, don't cast around the mismatch" rule with a price tag attached: an overloaded field type-checks and works in the happy path but diverges from what consumers filter/key on, and the failure only appears under multi-actor conditions where CI and single-user testing miss it.
