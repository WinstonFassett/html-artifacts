// Pure helpers for the apply-error recovery orchestrator. The wire-level
// orchestration (abort upstream + splice continuation events) lives in
// prompt-chat-section.ts; everything testable lives here.

// Continue mode ("you were here, continue"): the recovery prompt does NOT
// surface the failure to the model. It contains current file state plus
// (optionally) the assistant's own captured partial output, truncated to
// the last successful code.end, framed as a user-role resume message.
//
// Why user-framed and not assistant-prefill: extended-thinking Claude
// models (anthropic/claude-opus-4.7 in our setup) reject prefill at the
// model level — every provider in OpenRouter (Anthropic-direct, Bedrock,
// Vertex) returned 400 with "This model does not support assistant
// message prefill. The conversation must end with a user message."
// (chats z4Jbr2Q3EFgWFUnsau, z2uDNqY3Nym7eE9q6e, zYFWaxhUAKSvVrzeL).
// The user-framed wrapper works on every provider and every model.
// The anti-gaslight ("verify partial against CURRENT FILES") guidance
// lives in recovery-addendum.md instead.
