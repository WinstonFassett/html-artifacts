// Each db can carry an ACL granting capabilities to subjects, where
// subjects are built-in groups projected from the existing role grants:
//
//   members    = owner ∪ editor ∪ viewer ∪ submitter (anyone with a grant)
//   editors    = owner ∪ editor                       (actively co-editing)
//   submitters = owner ∪ submitter                    (write-only contributors)
//   readers    = owner ∪ editor ∪ viewer              (today's canRead set)
//
// Owner is implicitly in every group. Capabilities not listed in the ACL
// fall back to the per-action role gate (canRead / canWrite).
//
// Stored as ActiveDbAcl entries inside the existing AppSettings JSON
// blob (one entry per dbName). No new SQL table; reads happen via the
// regular ensureAppSettings flow.
